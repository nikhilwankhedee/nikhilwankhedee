## 🚀 Why I’m Here  
When I was younger, Iron Man wasn’t just a movie for me, it was a vision.  
J.A.R.V.I.S. wasn’t fiction, it was the blueprint.  
That spark is what pulled me into **Artificial Intelligence** and today, I’m pursuing engineering to make that vision real.  

I’ve explored different areas in tech, from building 12+ websites as a freelancer to running a marketing agency where I coded **automation tools with Python** to save hours of work. But now, I’m going all-in on what excites me the most: **AI + Python**.
